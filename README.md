This project involves processing sales data, performing data quality checks, and building a data pipeline for analysis. The data source comes from a kaggle data set featuring sales data of a UK based business.  By analyzing sales data, businesses can make informed decisions about product offerings, pricing strategies, inventory management, and marketing campaigns. This can lead to improved profitability and operational efficiency. Businesses can uncover valuable insights about customer behavior, market trends, and product performance. These insights can be used to tailor business strategies and improve customer satisfaction.  The data pipeline enables real-time or near-real-time monitoring of sales performance, allowing businesses to react quickly to changing market conditions and customer demands.

Developing this project involved the following steps:
Task 1: Set up Google Cloud Storage buckets for raw data ingestion.
Task 2: Create a BigQuery dataset to store and process the sales data.
Task 3: Write Python scripts for initial data processing and quality checks.
Task 4: Define DBT models for data transformation.
Task 5: Configure Apache Airflow DAGs to orchestrate the pipeline.
Task 6: Write SQL queries for data analysis in BigQuery.
Task 7: Implement Stackdriver for monitoring and logging.
Task 8: Configure security settings in GCP.
Task 9: Set up CI/CD pipelines with Cloud Build and Cloud Composer.
Task 10: Document the pipeline and schedule regular maintenance.

#Technologies used
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)- GCP provides the cloud infrastructure for hosting and running the data pipeline, including storage, compute, and networking services.

Apache Airflow- Apache Airflow is used to orchestrate the entire data pipeline, defining the workflow, dependencies, and scheduling of tasks.

BigQuery- BigQuery is used for storing, processing, and analyzing the sales data. It enables running SQL queries and generating reports to extract insights from the data.

SQL- SQL is used to write queries for data analysis in BigQuery, allowing for the extraction of specific information and the generation of custom reports.

Stackdriver- Stackdriver is used for monitoring and logging the performance of the data pipeline, tracking data quality, and logging any issues or errors that occur during data processing.

Python- Python is used for initial data processing, quality checks, and scripting tasks within the data pipeline.

Cloud Build- Cloud Build is used to set up CI/CD pipelines for automating the deployment and testing of the data pipeline.

Cloud Composer- Cloud Composer is used to manage the orchestration of the Apache Airflow environment, providing a fully managed workflow orchestration service.

CI/CD Pipelines- CI/CD pipelines are used to automate the deployment, testing, and validation of the data pipeline, ensuring continuous integration and continuous deployment of changes.

Data Build Tool (DBT)- DBT is used for defining and executing data transformation models, allowing for the transformation of raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.


#Software requirements
Google Cloud SDK:
The Google Cloud SDK can be downloaded and installed from the official Google Cloud website. Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.

Apache Airflow:
Apache Airflow can be installed using Python's package manager, pip. Use the command pip install apache-airflow to install Apache Airflow.

Python:
Python can be downloaded and installed from the official Python website. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

BigQuery Client Library:
The BigQuery client library for Python can be installed using pip. Use the command pip install google-cloud-bigquery to install the BigQuery client library.

DBT (Data Build Tool):
DBT can be installed using pip. Use the command pip install dbt to install DBT.

Cloud Build and Cloud Composer:
These GCP services can be set up and configured through the Google Cloud Console. Follow the documentation provided by Google Cloud Platform to set up Cloud Build and Cloud Composer.

SQL Client:
A SQL client or SQL IDE can be downloaded and installed from the respective software provider's website. Choose a SQL client that is compatible with your operating system.

Stackdriver:
Stackdriver is a part of the Google Cloud Platform and can be configured through the Google Cloud Console. Follow the documentation provided by Google Cloud Platform to set up and configure Stackdriver.


#Usage instructions 
Setting Up Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
Ensure that you have a GCP account and have set up the necessary permissions and access to create and manage resources within GCP.

Installing Google Cloud SDK:
Download and install the Google Cloud SDK from the official Google Cloud website. Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.

Setting Up Apache Airflow:
Install Apache Airflow using Python's package manager, pip. Use the command pip install apache-airflow to install Apache Airflow.

Configuring Python Environment:
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

Installing Required Python Libraries:
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip. Use the following commands to install the required libraries:
pip install google-cloud-bigquery for the BigQuery client library.
pip install dbt for the Data Build Tool (DBT).

Setting Up GCP Services:
Set up and configure GCP services such as Cloud Build, Cloud Composer, and Stackdriver through the Google Cloud Console. Follow the documentation provided by Google Cloud Platform to set up these services.

Running the Data Pipeline:
Once all the necessary components are set up and configured, you can run the data pipeline by executing the Apache Airflow DAGs. Monitor the pipeline's performance and logs using Stackdriver.
Data Analysis and Reporting:

Use SQL queries to perform data analysis in BigQuery and generate reports to extract insights from the processed sales data.

Maintenance and Documentation:


Schedule regular maintenance tasks to ensure the reliability and performance of the data pipeline. Document the pipeline, including the infrastructure, code, and processes, for future reference.
These usage instructions provide a high-level overview of the steps required to set up, run, and maintain the data pipeline for sales data analysis on the Google Cloud Platform.
